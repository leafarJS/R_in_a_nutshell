#LISTS
# An R list is an ordered collection of objects. Like vectors, you can refer to 
#elements in a list by position:
l <- list(1,2,3,4,5)
l

parcel <- list(destination="Bolivia",
               dimensions = c(3,6,9),
               price = 3.69)

parcel$dimensions
parcel$destination
parcel$price
